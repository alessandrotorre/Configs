Give the right permission of your mouse, and so you have to find its event number

~ cat /proc/bus/input/devices


I: Bus=0000 Vendor=0000 Product=0000 Version=0000
N: Name="tps65217_pwr_but"
P: Phys=
S: Sysfs=/devices/ocp.3/44e0b000.i2c/i2c-0/0-0024/input/input0
U: Uniq=
H: Handlers=kbd event0
B: PROP=0
B: EV=3
B: KEY=100000 0 0 0



And give the read and write permission to yours mouse event with

~ sudo chmod go+rw /dev/input/eventN            ##"N" is the number of yours mouse event

Now you can check this cofiguration and this component
You have to install the developer package about machinekit

sudo apt-get install machinekit-dev

from the pattern /home/machinekit/linuxcnc/configs/ARM.BeagleBone-mouse/
Open the e_check.comp and enter your email in line 163:

system("cat pause.txt | mail -s \" Pause for filament\" user@email.com");

Compile and install the component
~ sudo comp --compile e_check.comp
~ sudo comp --install e_check.comp
