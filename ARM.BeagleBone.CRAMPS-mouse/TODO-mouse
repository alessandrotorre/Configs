TTODO

-synch the extruder and joint position every x mm of filament extruder for reduce mechanical errors of lift or scales issues. 
Problems? the input.0.rel-wheel-position is an out pin and I can't write it. possible solution: it has a reset pin value that put the position to "0" or find/write a proper component to read the mouse wheel.
---fixed by the code but it can be more simple code if the input is IO instead of IN.

- find home A pin to check the A-home status- done

-if the component pause the print write an alert email- done

-if program pause for a component add a check cicle for attempting to unclogg the hotend, incrementing the heating and trying to extrude. if the check goes ok restart the print

-adapt the component in case of velocity_extrusion type 

-store the program line (pin motion.program-line) - done

-Reboot constraint to give the permissions go+rw about input device and the number of the event of the device can be different from the last time before rebooting

I installed postfix and mailx then it just worked fine straight off. The M112 goes above M30 and once it sends the mail the code just carries on to M30.
As ArcEye says, The M112 must be located in the directory set out in your .ini file
eg.
[DISPLAY]
.....
PROGRAM_PREFIX = /home/me/emc2/ngc

Make sure you add the address to your contacts in your normal email client (gmail or hotmail or whatever) or it will be spam filtered
